# Introduction

Repository to track the development of EHDEN's Service Desk.

A service desk is a communications center that provides a single point of contact (SPOC) between a company and its customers, employees and business partners. The purpose of a service desk is fundamentally different from a helpdesk. A service desk provides services to support all the organizational needs, this can include call management, knowledge base, etc. A helpdesk is often more focused on providing technical support to individual users only. 

The EHDEN Service Desk will contain a self-service portal (https://servicedesk.ehden.eu), an email process (servicedesk@ehden.eu), and a phone number (to be reserved).

The purpose of this repository is to define the scope and implementation details of all the services supported by the Service Desk. It will define the process steps for each of services, including the roles of its operators. For this it is important define the minimal viable product that contains at least 80% of the services we want to include from the start and then grow and refine this during the upcoming period.
